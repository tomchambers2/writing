* fake news is a we think more and more about as more of our communication and information sharing goes online

* what is the problem?
  * the problem is not actually new in many ways - so the solutions aren't new
  * in other ways it is brand new, because our capabilities have changed
  * its centred around trust
  * trust used to be the preserve of large institutions, because of their capabilities
  * now capability is spread out, its something many people or groups can access
  * example: to broadcast was a privileged capability, now anyone can broadcast
  * example: production of professional looking documents or marks
  * example: physical location
  * example: your friend telling you some news - do you trust them? 
  * all of these things brought trust, and now they don't exist
  * but when you go on the guardian or the new york times - why do you believe it? trust
  * if people don't have trust or trust in the wrong sources or identifiers, that's when truth breaks down

* what doesn't work is decentralised systems alone - that assumes the problem is abuse of power by an institution. but the problem is the loss of that power.
* there's an instinct to regulate to try and go back to what we had before
* but this won't work - the underlying technology has changed. capability can't be uncreated, the cost of copying information is nothing and it's impossible to penalise
* so neither of these are right, because neither of them can create trust now

* so how do we build trust again? how do we make truth? how do we avoid division?
* with a mix of technology and how we use technology

* what can help us is an understanding of networks, how do we communicate?
* what if the solution to division, to partisanship was to break up completely?


but what are the solutions? not sure.
