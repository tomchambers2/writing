"I used to be with it, but then they changed what "it" was. Now, what I'm with isn't it, and what's "it" seems weird and scary to me."

It's difficult to put it better than Abe Simpson when it comes to the relationship between old and young. Perhaps Douglas Adams:

“I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.”

I've always wanted to stay current. I guess it's that fear of death translated into actionable form in trying to stay near where it feels like things are moving and trying to avoid the inevitable procession on the aging travelator, not even realising that you're moving until the whole thing stops. Not for me, I said, the time honoured tradition of growing ever more out of touch ending up at the point where sending an email induces a panic attack.

I'm 31 now. There's something I didn't understand about aging before. I thought it was enough to stay up to date with trends, to observe them. As long as I read the right news and kept abreast of new technologies I'd be fine.

It turns out that's not enough. Because the new things just seem silly! What do you mean influencer? What a laughable concept. Some flash in the pan thing that will never last. A complete triviality. Memes! They're just jokes. You can argue the merits of online influencing or captioned images of cats. But they are actually new forms of power and communication. I missed that because I saw it from the outside. That's the weird. New things just seem silly because I haven't experience their power.

I could address that, by reminding myself to take everything seriously. I might get duped as much as I catch the new trends, but I could tread water and stay in place. But there's an aspect that's harder to work around. When I was a teenager, these movements and changes I felt a part of. The rise of the internet was in time with my own maturation. It was the thing that was going to change the world and I was going to be one of the ones changing it. There's a sense of belonging.

The inverse is true of anything that young people do today that's different. For me it creates a sense of alienation. It's their change, their movement. And that makes it frightening. When the change is social or communicative it leaves me even more high and dry, without partners to explore the change with unless I really step awkwardly into the younger world.

The world hasn't just moved on, it's moved on without me. The new place is not just different, it's uncomfortable because it's not mine. So the natural unconcious process is to retreat back to what is comfortable - the concepts and practices that I grew up with and know well.

I think this should be a lesson for me. Leaving youth is something that happens whatever you do. Like trying to alter history through time travel, no matter what I try to focus on something else will change in the periphery and the universe will apply a correction until the process is restored.
