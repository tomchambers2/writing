I was ahead of the curve when it came to not just remote working, but remote everything. Already working from home I dreamed of a world where I didn't have to leave the house at all - maximum efficiency, think of all the time saved not getting from place to place. I could live in the woods and yet still be a city person.

I haven't given up that vision but the pandemic has created a forced experiment for me to see how that plays out. A lot of it (given the fortune of a decent sized flat I share with my girlfriend and immediate access to parks) has played out the way I expected. I don't have to shuffle in on the train to work. The long slog across London to get to friend's houses or restaurants has been replaced by instantly jumping on Zoom. Perhaps this sounds a bit tragic to you already.

What I've found interesting though is what's missing from this. For me it breaks down into two kinds of contact that are difficult to get online.

# Incidental contact

By this I mean bumping into people in the street. The conversation you wouldn't otherwise have with a person you don't know well enough to explicitly call on the phone just for a chat. Or colleagues at work who you have contact with just because you're in the same physical space. All of these kinds of contacts happen because they're convenient. There's a lack of friction in asking about someones weekend while making a cup of tea, or talking about the weather having met into someone on the street. Sometimes these relationships stay as they are, continuing at a distance, but adding to the richness of social life.


# Peripheral contact

Peripheral contact is similar, but the friends of your friends. Again, the people with whom you're not close enough to deliberately arrange a meeting with, but they are also part of the richness of social life. By meeting these people you expand your network. You might not become friends otherwise, but you have the opportunity to get to know each other in a more comfortable way. Or perhaps your meetings are just mediated by someone who fills the conversation and brings the best out of you, to make possible a relationship that would otherwise falter.

# Sense of distance

The other effect of engaging through the web is the sense of distance from humanity. When I'm online it's difficult to feel recognised. The web filters out the crap to bring us the best music, the most exciting television. Everything created in the entire world is available right now. That includes people who are living fabulous lives adored by millions making art or music or tech entrepreneurs with vast follower counts. It spans hundreds or even thousands of people who are trying to do your exact niche and quite possibly better than you could do it.

When I think about releasing my own creative projects into this world, it feels like I'm going to watch my little paper boat get capsized in the wash of a cargo ship as it sails by uncaringly.

In real life impressions of me bounce around, I get reflected back from all the people in my life who see me, who see the things I do.

All of this is technically possible online. I could befriend local shopkeepers on facebook and ask them how's it going and wait for them to say, "fine thanks". I could find a specific community online and give and take primarily from that.

But the internet doesn't aid these ways of engaging. Incidental contact happens because it's frictionless to have those kinds of conversations in person, but you're there in person because of the friction involved in buying eggs or getting your hair cut. It's work to go down to the shop and that provides a purpose that puts you in the same place as other people working at a similar aim.

Community can be very inefficient. People working in restaurants develop strong bonds because it's hard work and demands a lot of commitment. A common purpose allows you to recognise each other as allies. I don't even have the common purpose of visiting Tesco anymore. The absence of that kind of contact - being reflected, being treated with respect, feeling a part of something, even if for a brief moment is vital to feeling part of society.

Without those moments other things start to take hold. I start to use news and statistics as a way of understanding other people, of my own place. The projections that live in my head become the default way of explaining other people and their behaviour. The other day on my biannual wander down to the high street I bumped into two people. One who was apologetic about her dog running over and another man who observed with humour that we'd both tripped over on the same step. I hadn't actually tripped but it made more sense to enjoy the moment and not dispute it.

All of this is to say that I wonder how we will fill that void left by the receding kinds of contacts. Although a lifelong atheist, I see the value of church in creating kinship and community. It has all the elements: shared belief and common purpose, a boundary of inclusion (mostly geographic) and a physical location to provide for incidental meetings.

Can this be achieved in a world that's primarily digital? The students who are sat at home or isolating in dorm rooms probably say no right now. We can efficiently transfer information, you can learn everything you need online. You can maintain good relationships or even build new ones where there is some reason for a lot of contact or you're highly motivated, like a shared project or dating. But the friction involved makes anything else very hard and we don't have the tools or cultural practices to make that work.

We may have the end of the pandemic in sight, but the prototypical solutions to digital communing will be needed for much much longer.
